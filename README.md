# ZigZag

Library forked with fixes to run properly with Python 3.10

ZigZag provides functions for identifying the peaks and valleys of a time
series. Additionally, it provides a function for computing the maximum drawdown.

For fastest understanding, [view the IPython notebook demo tutorial](https://github.com/jbn/ZigZag/blob/master/zigzag_demo.ipynb>).
